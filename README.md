# The Universal Data Cube Visualization System

The UDCViS is a conceptually designed system in an early phase of 
implementation. It is a research project of Curran Kelleher.

The code is available in the [UDCViS GitHub Repo](https://github.com/curran/udcvis).

The software and data are published at [UniversalDataCube.org](http://universaldatacube.org).

The idea is as follows:

 * Public data sets can be published to the Semantic Web using the 
   RDF Data Cube Vocabulary.
 * These data sets can be consumed by browser-based clients and 
   integrated together in memory by resolving OWL sameAs links.
 * These data sets can be explored and presented using a general-purpose
   information visualization framework built on Web technologies that
   has the following features:
    * Multiple linked views
    * Brushed selection and probing
    * History navigation
    * Asynchronous collaboration (view sharing and history sharing)
    * Synchronous colalboration (immediate updates like Google Docs)
    * Embeddable within Web pages
 * This collection of data sets and interactive visualization 
   framework can be incrementally built up over time by a large 
   number of contributors from around the world,
 * Target users include:
   * Educators
   * Journalists
   * Policy Makers
   * Scientists
   * The general public

The versioning scheme is as follows:

 * [0.1 - September - October 2012](./0.1/) - Stand-alone prototypes proofs
   of concept, and technology tests.
 * [0.2 - October - December 2012](./0.2) - A first attempt at building 
   foundational UDCViS modules.
 * 0.3 - January - March 2012 - A refactoring of UDCViS modules.
 * 0.4 ... 0.9
   * Continual refinement of modules, architecture, and example applications.
   * Recruitment of users, contributors, and collaborators.
   * Iterative design from user feedback.
 * 1.0 - 2014 - A final version corresponding to a completed dissertation.
