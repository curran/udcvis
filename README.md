# The Universal Data Cube <br>Visualization System<br>(UDCViS)
##### [Curran Kelleher](http://universalvisualization.org/?page_id=2)
##### October 2012

 * An early-stage research project.
 * Planned to be completed by 2014.
 * Open source code: [UDCViS GitHub Repo](https://github.com/curran/udcvis).
 * Running live: [UniversalDataCube.org](http://universaldatacube.org).

The idea is as follows:

 * Public data sets are on the Web,
   * but are often not accessible.
 * These can be published in the Semantic Web.
   * Using the [RDF Data Cube Vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/).
 * This RDF data can be integrated in the browser.
 * The integrated data can be explored with:
   * Multiple linked views
   * Brushed selection and probing
   * History navigation
   * Asynchronous collaboration
     * view sharing
     * history sharing
   * Synchronous colalboration
     * immediate updates like Google Docs
   * Embeddable within Web pages
 * Mass-collaboration can be leveraged to evolve a global commons of:
   * Data sets
   * Visualization software
   * User-generated visualizations
 * Target users include:
   * Educators
   * Journalists
   * Policy Makers
   * Researchers
   * The general public

The versioning scheme is as follows:

 * [0.1](http://universaldatacube.org/0.1/): September - October 2012
   * Stand-alone prototypes
   * Proofs of concept
   * Technology tests
 * [0.2](http://universaldatacube.org/0.2/pages/): October - December 2012
   * A first prototype of the UDCViS modules
   * Example applications
   * Technology tests
 * 0.3: January - March 2012
  * A refactoring of UDCViS modules.
 * 0.4 ... 0.9
   * Continual refinement of modules, architecture, and example applications.
   * Recruitment of users, contributors, and collaborators.
   * Iterative design from user feedback.
 * 1.0 - 2014 - A final version corresponding to a completed dissertation.
