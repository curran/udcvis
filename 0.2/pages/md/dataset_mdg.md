# UN Millenium Development Goals Indicators

Here is a quote typical of the MDG effort, from their
[2012 Annual Report](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2012/English2012.pdf):

 * <strong>Extreme poverty is falling in every region</strong> <br>
 For the first time since poverty trends began to be monitored, 
 the number of people living in extreme poverty and poverty 
 rates fell in every developing region - including in subSaharan 
 Africa, where rates are highest. The proportion of 
 people living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 47 per cent 
 in 1990 to 24 per cent in 2008 - a reduction from over
 2 billion to less than 1.4 billion.

To support this statement and additional discussion, they provide the
 following visualization on page 10 of the annual report:

Some interesting properties of this visualization are:

 * The aggregated regions are in a different color.
 * Luminance encodes year.
 * The target is included to orient the reader.
