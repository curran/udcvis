The purpose of the UDC is to provide a data source for:

 * Thematic Maps
 * Scatter Plots
 * Bar Charts
 * Pie Charts
 * Tree Maps
 * Line Charts
 * Area Charts
 * Heat Maps
 * Table Views

Common to all of these visualization techniques is the following:

 * Selection of members within a dimension
 * Selection of measures
 * Selection of data sets

The UDC client can consume data from multiple sources. The view of the UDC that one gets is determined by the set of data sources used.

To get the project started, a set of "dummy" dimensions has been created as follows:
<div id="udcDataView"></div>
<script src="requireJSConfig.js"> </script>
<script src="../lib/require-jquery.js"></script>
<script src="populateUDCDataView.js">
</script>
