This is an example Node.js server that serves a single static page (index.html) and implements a chat server on WebSockets using the socket.io library.

To test, start the server with
node app.js

1. Open three browsers to localhost:8080
2. Open the Javascript console of each
3. In the JS console, execute send('foo')
This should cause 'foo' to be output in all the other browser windows.
