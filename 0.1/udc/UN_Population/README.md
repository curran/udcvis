This directory contains code for preprocessing the [UN Population data](http://esa.un.org/wpp/Excel-Data/DB02_Stock_Indicators/WPP2010_DB2_F01_TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES.XLS). The process is as follows:
 1. Download the data (Excel file)
 2. Use a spreadsheet program (OpenOffice) to extract the data content (excluding the title area)
 3. Remove the unnecessary columns: Index, Variant, Notes
 4. Save the file as UN_Population.csv
